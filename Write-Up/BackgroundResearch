 Background Research
	Cellular Automaton(CA), also known as cellular spaces, is a discrete model that is used in mathematics, science, computation theory, and modeling. A CA will usually consist of a regular grid of cells, each one in one of a finite number of states such as dead or alive, infected or cured. This grid can be any dimension with infinite number of squares. The rule for updating each state will usually be constant, but it can change in  stochastic cellular automaton and asynchronous cellular automaton. 
	There are four primary classifications to automata:
automata in which patterns generally stabilize into homogeneity
automata in which patterns evolve into mostly stable or oscillating structures
automata in which patterns evolve in a seemingly chaotic fashion
automata in which patterns become extremely complex and may last for a long time, with stable local structures.
	Epidemic simulation is the simulation of epidemics. For our project, we will be using Cellular Automata to simulate the spread of an epidemic. Epidemiology is the branch of medicine that deals with the control of diseases. Epidemic models all share one property: The virtual world in which they run is an idealized and approximate one. When modelling a complex system, there is a trade-of between the model's degree of concept and its usefulness. The question for this is what details can be excluded without devaluating or destroying the results.
