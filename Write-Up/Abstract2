With recent epidemics reaching pandemic levels, there is an increased urgency to understand how the spread of disease functions in a complex system and what can be done to prevent it. A common approach to solving this problem is developing a model (either computerized or mathematical) that is capable of active and accurate simulation. Advancements in technology have allowed for geographical application of these models, but the most important aspect remains to be the interactions between the people in the environment. Cellular Automata (CA) has been extensively studied in the field of discrete mathematics and complex systems but only recently have they attracted attention in epidemiology. In its most basic form a CA is a 1 dimensional array of cells (each cell is in one of two states) with evolving configurations based on a defined transition rule and discrete time steps. In order to make it a viable option for epidemic simulation, these fundamental properties need to be extended. The nested CA based model follows the same general principles with the exception of representing the individual outer cells as their own self-contained environment. Although the statement seems very simple, the implications are far reaching. With a standard cell, a very complex part of the environment is represented as an abstraction with only one state/attribute. By replacing this oversimplification with a nested CA, the environmental actor is represented in all of its intrinsic complexity. Combining this paradigm with technologies such as geographic information systems and ML creates a model with the benefits of extensive empirical data in addition to accurate interactive dynamics.
